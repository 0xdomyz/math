# Exploitability & Exploitation

## 1. Concept Skeleton
**Definition:** Exploitability measures how much EV a best response can gain against a strategy  
**Purpose:** Quantify leakage from non-GTO play; target profitable deviations  
**Prerequisites:** Game theory, mixed strategies, expected value

## 2. Comparative Framing
| Strategy Type | Exploitability | EV vs Weak Opponent | Risk |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Perfect GTO | 0 | Moderate | Low variance |
| Slightly imbalanced | Low | High | Medium |
| Highly exploitable | High | High vs weak, low vs strong | High |

## 3. Examples + Counterexamples
**Simple Example:** Over-folding to raises lets a bluffer profit by raising wide.  
**Failure Case:** Over-exploiting a balanced opponent decreases EV.  
**Edge Case:** Meta-games shift; yesterday’s exploit is tomorrow’s leak.

## 4. Layer Breakdown
```
Exploitability:
├─ Model opponent strategy
├─ Compute best response EV
├─ Compare to baseline (equilibrium EV)
├─ Identify leaks (over/under folds, sizing errors)
└─ Apply controlled deviations
```

## 5. Mini-Project
Compute exploitability in a 2x2 game:
```python
import numpy as np

payoff = np.array([[1, -1], [-2, 2]])  # row player payoff

def best_response_value(p_col):
    ev_rows = payoff @ p_col
    return ev_rows.max(), ev_rows.argmax()

p_col = np.array([0.6, 0.4])  # opponent mix
br_val, br_action = best_response_value(p_col)

ev_mix = np.array([0.5, 0.5]) @ (payoff @ p_col)
exploitability = br_val - ev_mix

print("Best response action:", br_action)
print("Exploitability:", round(exploitability, 3))
```

## 6. Challenge Round
- Estimating opponent frequencies from small samples is noisy.  
- Overfitting to short-term reads increases risk.  
- Exploitability changes as opponents adapt.
