# Dependent Coverage: Spouse & Child Benefits

## 1. Concept Skeleton
**Definition:** Life insurance benefits extending coverage to employee's spouse and/or children; typically fixed dollar amounts less than employee benefit  
**Purpose:** Provide financial security for family; bridge household income until children reach independence; often employer-paid (valuable benefit)  
**Prerequisites:** Group life basics, beneficiary designations, family income replacement

## 2. Comparative Framing
| Aspect | **Spouse Coverage** | **Child Coverage** | **Employee Benefit** |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Typical Benefit** | 25–50% of employee | Fixed $5K–$25K per child | 1–3× salary |
| **Maximum** | Often $100K cap | $5K–$50K aggregate | No cap or $500K+ |
| **Duration** | Until age 65 or divorce | Until age 23–26 (dependent age) | Until age 65–70 |
| **Premium** | Employer or employee-paid | Usually employer-paid | Employer + employee |
| **Cost per employee** | ~$3–$10/month | ~$2–$5/month | ~$20–$50/month |

## 3. Examples + Counterexamples

**Spouse Coverage Example:**  
Employee age 45, married, $100K salary, 2× salary benefit = $200K employee benefit. Plan offers spouse coverage at 50% = $100K spouse benefit. Monthly premium for spouse coverage: $5/month (employer-paid). If spouse predeceases, benefit terminates

**Child Coverage Example:**  
Employee with 3 children (ages 8, 12, 14). Plan offers $10K per child to age 26. Total child benefits: $30K (if all remain eligible). Upon child turning 26 or finishing college, coverage automatically terminates

**Survivor Needs Example:**  
Household income (both working): Employee $80K + spouse $60K = $140K. If employee dies: Spouse still earns $60K; needs bridge income. Employee benefit ($160K for 2× salary) + spouse benefit ($80K at 50%) = $240K. Social Security survivor benefit adds $24K/year to household. Total 5-year support: ~$380K

**Non-Example (No Dependent Coverage):**  
Young, single employee, no children. Plan offers dependent coverage but employee waives (saves ~$7/month). Upon marriage, open enrollment triggered; can enroll spouse during life event window

**Edge Case:**  
Blended family: Employee remarries; new spouse and stepchildren. Plan language may limit to biological/adopted children; stepchildren require special definition. Benefit portability upon divorce requires careful administration

## 4. Layer Breakdown
```
Dependent Coverage Structure:
├─ Spouse Coverage:
│   ├─ Definition & Eligibility:
│   │   ├─ Legal spouse: Married under state law (same-sex now included)
│   │   ├─ Domestic partner: Some plans include (state-dependent)
│   │   ├─ Waiting period: Often 12 months post-marriage (prevents selection gaming)
│   │   ├─ Proof of marriage: Requires marriage certificate at enrollment
│   │   ├─ Age limits: Typically coverage to spouse's age 65 (or plan maximum)
│   │   └─ Enrollment: Employee elects at initial hire or open enrollment
│   │
│   ├─ Benefit Design:
│   │   ├─ Fixed dollar amount:
│   │   │   ├─ Common: $50K, $100K, $150K (flat for all employees)
│   │   │   ├─ Advantage: Simple; same cost per employee
│   │   │   ├─ Disadvantage: Inadequate for high earners, overly generous for low
│   │   │   └─ Use: Smaller employers; unions
│   │   │
│   │   ├─ Percentage of employee benefit:
│   │   │   ├─ Common: 25%, 33%, 50% of employee benefit
│   │   │   ├─ Example: Employee $100K benefit → Spouse 50% = $50K
│   │   │   ├─ Advantage: Scales with family income (proportional)
│   │   │   ├─ Disadvantage: Higher earner spouse gets more benefit
│   │   │   └─ Market standard: 50% most common
│   │   │
│   │   └─ Cap structures:
│   │       ├─ Spouse max: Often $100K or $150K (limits liability)
│   │       ├─ Example: 50% of employee, but not >$100K
│   │       │   ├─ Employee $100K benefit → Spouse $50K (no cap)
│   │       │   ├─ Employee $300K benefit → Spouse $100K (capped, not $150K)
│   │       └─ Rationale: Prevent very high earner spouses from inflating cost
│   │
│   ├─ Underwriting:
│   │   ├─ Guarantee issue: All spouses auto-approved (no medical exam)
│   │   │   ├─ Rationale: Group underwriting covers all; no individual selection
│   │   │   ├─ Adverse selection: Minimal (healthy spouse enrolls alongside employee)
│   │   │   └─ Timing: At employee enrollment or marriage
│   │   ├─ Medical underwriting (above guarantee):
│   │   │   ├─ Large amount: If spouse benefit >$100K, may require health form
│   │   │   ├─ Approval: Usually streamlined (group underwriting context)
│   │   │   └─ Timeline: 2-3 weeks
│   │   └─ Participation:
│   │       ├─ Election: Employee elects spouse coverage yes/no
│   │       ├─ Discontinue: Can drop after marriage stability (often ≥12 months)
│   │       ├─ Cancel event: Divorce automatically terminates spouse benefit
│   │       └─ Portability: Spouse may convert to individual policy post-termination
│   │
│   ├─ Premium & Costs:
│   │   ├─ Employer-paid (common): Employer covers full spouse premium
│   │   │   ├─ Benefit: No employee payroll deduction
│   │   │   ├─ Cost to employer: ~$3–$10/month per employee
│   │   │   ├─ Tax implication: May be taxable income to employee (IRS rule)
│   │   │   └─ Advantage: Increases participation & retention
│   │   │
│   │   ├─ Employee-paid: Employee elects and pays via payroll
│   │   │   ├─ Cost: ~$3–$8/month (employee deduction, pre-tax under IRC 104)
│   │   │   ├─ Advantage: No employer cost burden
│   │   │   ├─ Disadvantage: Lower participation; perceived as separate cost
│   │   │   └─ Tax treatment: Pre-tax if within group plan
│   │   │
│   │   └─ Shared cost: Employer + employee split (rare)
│   │
│   ├─ Termination Events:
│   │   ├─ Divorce: Automatic termination (state law enforcement)
│   │   ├─ Death of spouse: Benefit paid to spouse's estate; employee continues
│   │   ├─ Plan cancellation: Conversion option available (usually)
│   │   ├─ Job loss: COBRA continuation option (spouse can continue coverage)
│   │   └─ Retirement: Spouse coverage often terminates at age 65
│   │
│   └─ Integration with Social Security:
│       ├─ Spouse survivor benefit (SSNB): Widow/widower at age 60 gets 71.5% of PIA
│       ├─ Widow with children: Can receive at any age if caring for minor <16
│       ├─ Total household benefit:
│       │   ├─ Example: Employee $150K benefit + spouse coverage $75K = $225K lump sum
│       │   ├─ Plus Social Security: ~$24K/year for spouse/children until age 18
│       │   ├─ 5-year total: ~$225K + $120K = $345K
│       │   └─ Planning: Adequate for most households (10+ years income replacement)
│       └─ Coordination: Life insurance supplements SSNB; not offset
│
├─ Child Coverage:
│   ├─ Definitions & Eligibility:
│   │   ├─ Eligible children:
│   │   │   ├─ Biological: Natural child of employee
│   │   │   ├─ Adopted: Legal adoption (most plans cover same as biological)
│   │   │   ├─ Stepchildren: Varies; some plans require living with employee
│   │   │   ├─ Foster children: Rarely covered (not legal responsibility)
│   │   │   └─ Ward: Depends on plan language; usually excluded
│   │   │
│   │   ├─ Age limits:
│   │   │   ├─ Minimum: Typically coverage from 14 days old (allows for SIDS risk)
│   │   │   ├─ Maximum age for full coverage: Usually age 23–26
│   │   │   │   ├─ Age 23: Student status no longer required (post-grad)
│   │   │   │   ├─ Age 25: Graduate school support (high earning potential)
│   │   │   │   └─ Age 26: ACA-aligned (match health insurance limits)
│   │   │   ├─ Student exemption: Some plans extend to age 26 if in school full-time
│   │   │   └─ Disabled child: Coverage may extend indefinitely if dependent
│   │   │
│   │   ├─ Number of children:
│   │   │   ├─ Per-child limit: Typically each child covered same amount
│   │   │   ├─ Aggregate limit: Total child benefits capped (e.g., $50K all children)
│   │   │   ├─ Common example: $10K per child, max $50K aggregate = up to 5 children
│   │   │   └─ Large families: May exceed aggregate; insurer can limit
│   │   │
│   │   └─ Proof of insurability:
│   │       ├─ Newborn: Automatic at birth (if parent eligible)
│   │       ├─ Adoption: May require adoption papers
│   │       ├─ Later addition: No medical exam (group coverage)
│   │       └─ Timing: Coverage effective at birth; retroactive to delivery
│   │
│   ├─ Benefit Design:
│   │   ├─ Fixed per-child amount:
│   │   │   ├─ Common: $5K, $10K, $15K per child
│   │   │   ├─ Example: $10K per child × 3 children = $30K total
│   │   │   ├─ Market standard: $10K–$15K per child (covers funeral, burial)
│   │   │   ├─ Purpose: Financial shock absorption, not full income replacement
│   │   │   └─ Use: All group plans
│   │   │
│   │   ├─ Aggregate child benefit:
│   │   │   ├─ Total limit: $30K–$50K for all children combined
│   │   │   ├─ Example: $10K per child, max $50K aggregate
│   │   │   ├─ Impact: Large families may not fully cover all children
│   │   │   └─ Fairness: Limits cost; prevents adverse selection (large families)
│   │   │
│   │   └─ Age-based reduction (less common for children):
│   │       ├─ Newborn: Sometimes 10% of benefit (< age 6 months)
│   │       ├─ Adult child: Reduced benefit after age 23 (or student status ends)
│   │       └─ Disability: Continues indefinitely if disabled before age limit
│   │
│   ├─ Underwriting (always guaranteed issue):
│   │   ├─ No medical exam required: All employees' children auto-covered
│   │   ├─ Proof: Usually birth certificate or adoption decree
│   │   ├─ Adverse selection: Minimal (typically healthy children; rare claims)
│   │   ├─ Cost basis: Flat rate per child (not risk-based)
│   │   └─ Waiver: Parent can elect not to cover children (saves premium)
│   │
│   ├─ Premium & Costs:
│   │   ├─ Employer-paid (most common): Employer covers 100% of child premium
│   │   │   ├─ Cost: ~$2–$5/month per employee (for up to 3–4 children)
│   │   │   ├─ All-employee cost: Low (~$2,000/year for 500-person group)
│   │   │   ├─ Advantage: Valuable benefit; improves morale
│   │   │   └─ Tax: May be taxable to employee (IRS rule on group benefits)
│   │   │
│   │   ├─ No separate employee cost: Included in group plan premium
│   │   │   ├─ Simplified: No payroll deduction; fully employer-subsidized
│   │   │   └─ Participation: Higher (not optional; automatic for children)
│   │   │
│   │   └─ Optional employee contributions: Rare; usually waived
│   │
│   ├─ Termination Events:
│   │   ├─ Age limit reached: Coverage stops on birthday (age 23–26)
│   │   │   ├─ Notice: Plan should inform employee 30 days prior
│   │   │   ├─ Conversion: Some plans allow convert to individual policy
│   │   │   └─ Timeline: 30-day window post-termination for conversion
│   │   │
│   │   ├─ Dependent status lost: Marriage, full-time employment, military
│   │   │   ├─ Example: Child turns 24, gets full-time job → coverage ends
│   │   │   └─ Verification: Plan may request proof of dependent status
│   │   │
│   │   ├─ Employee job loss: COBRA continuation available (child coverage continues)
│   │   ├─ Plan cancellation: Coverage terminates; no conversion typically
│   │   └─ Disabled child: May continue indefinitely if approved
│   │
│   └─ Use & Claims:
│       ├─ Rare events: Child death (0.1–0.3% of population annually)
│       ├─ Common causes: SIDS (infants), accidents (school-age), suicide (teens)
│       ├─ Benefit use: Funeral/burial costs ($10K–$15K typical)
│       ├─ Emotional value: Ensures proper interment; financial relief to parents
│       └─ Total value: Modest financial but significant psychological benefit
│
└─ Administration & Compliance:
    ├─ Enrollment process:
    │   ├─ Employee election: At hire or open enrollment
    │   ├─ Spouse/child list: Provide names, DOB, relationship
    │   ├─ Proof of relationship: Marriage cert (spouse), birth cert (children)
    │   ├─ Beneficiary designation: Typically employee is beneficiary; can name other
    │   └─ Timing: Changes effective per plan rules (usually next payroll)
    │
    ├─ Ongoing administration:
    │   ├─ Life events: Marriage → add spouse; birth → add child; divorce → remove spouse
    │   ├─ Age monitoring: Track children turning dependent age limit (auto-terminate)
    │   ├─ Verification: Annually confirm dependent status (for active employees)
    │   └─ Claims support: Beneficiary files claim with death certificate
    │
    ├─ Tax treatment:
    │   ├─ Employer-paid group term life: Up to $50K excludable from employee income
    │   ├─ Excess (>$50K): Taxable as imputed income (using IRS Table 2001 rates)
    │   ├─ Dependent coverage: Included in $50K limit (shared with employee benefit)
    │   ├─ Example: Employee $100K (included) + spouse $50K (included) + children $20K
    │   │   ├─ Total: $170K
    │   │   ├─ Excludable: $50K (IRS limit per person)
    │   │   ├─ Taxable: $120K (excess; taxed at IRS Table 2001 rates)
    │   │   ├─ Est. tax impact: ~$0.25/day × $120K = ~$30/month taxable
    │   │   └─ Employee reports: W-2 income inclusion
    │   │
    │   └─ Group insurance planning: Coordinate with total comp; dependent coverage adds value
    │
    └─ ERISA Compliance:
        ├─ Non-discrimination: Dependent coverage offered uniformly
        ├─ Notice requirement: Plan document explains dependent eligibility
        ├─ Beneficiary rights: Spouse/children have notice of benefits
        └─ COBRA: Spouse/children entitled to 36-month continuation upon divorce/death

# Insights
print("\n\nKEY INSIGHTS:")
print(f"Standard design (2× + 50% spouse + child): ~70–90% adequacy for most households")
print(f"Generous design (3× + 75% spouse + child): ~100%+ adequacy for most households")
print(f"Social Security adds 15–25% of total resources (significant buffer)")
print(f"Single-earner families: More dependent on group life (no secondary income)")
print(f"Dual-income families: Better able to absorb loss; lower group life need")
```

**Key Insights:**
- Spouse coverage: Essential for single-earner households; 50% standard
- Child coverage: Small dollar amount but significant emotional value; nearly universal
- Combined impact: Group life + dependent + SS provides 70–100%+ adequacy for most
- Single-earner households: Especially vulnerable; need higher coverage levels
