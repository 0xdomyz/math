# Short-Term Disability (STD)

## 1. Concept Skeleton
**Definition:** Income replacement insurance for temporary work inability; covers 13-26 weeks of absence; typically 50-70% of salary; triggered by illness, injury, or medical event  
**Purpose:** Employee financial security during recovery; partial wage replacement; encourages return-to-work; employer retention tool; statutory requirement in some jurisdictions  
**Prerequisites:** Disability definition, elimination period, benefit period, medical underwriting, occupational classification

## 2. Comparative Framing
| Feature | STD (Short-Term) | LTD (Long-Term) | Workers' Comp | Unemployment |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Duration** | 13-26 weeks | 2-65 years (age 65) | Until recovery | 26 weeks (varies) |
| **Replacement** | 50-70% of salary | 50-66% of salary | 66.67% of salary | Fixed weekly $ |
| **Trigger** | Any medical condition | Same, after STD ends | Work-related injury/illness | Job loss |
| **Waiting** | 0-7 days (elimination) | 90-180 days | 3-7 days | 1-2 weeks |
| **Coverage** | Non-occupational | Non-occupational | Occupational only | N/A (employment status) |
| **Cost** | Employer 0.3-0.6% payroll | Employer 0.1-0.3% payroll | Employer (varies by state) | Payroll tax |

## 3. Examples + Counterexamples

**Simple Example:**  
Employee age 35, salary $50K/year; STD benefit 60% × $50K = $30K/year; goes on leave for surgery + 4-week recovery; receives $30K ÷ 52 weeks × 4 weeks = $2,308 while absent

**Failure Case:**  
Employee claims disability; insurer requests doctor's certification; employee's physician refuses to complete form; coverage denied for lack of proof; dispute; employee claims breach of contract; regulatory complaint filed

**Edge Case:**  
Employee on STD 6 weeks; recovery incomplete; LTD kicks in; receives $2,500/week STD for remaining 2 weeks + $1,500/week LTD simultaneously; double-dips; insurer sues for overpayment; coordination-of-benefits violation

## 4. Layer Breakdown
```
Short-Term Disability Structure:
├─ Eligibility & Coverage:
│   ├─ Eligible Employees:
│   │   ├─ Full-time typically; may exclude part-time, temporary, seasonal
│   │   ├─ Waiting period: Often 30-90 days from hire; reduces adverse selection
│   │   ├─ Industry scope: Most industries covered; some exclusions possible
│   │   │   ├─ Covered: Office, retail, healthcare, education, light manufacturing
│   │   │   ├─ Excluded: Some states exclude farmers, independent contractors
│   │   │   └─ Special: Construction, hazardous occupations may have restrictions
│   │   ├─ Occupational class:
│   │   │   ├─ Class 1: Office/professional → Lower rates; low injury risk
│   │   │   ├─ Class 2: Light manufacturing, sales → Medium rates
│   │   │   ├─ Class 3: Heavy manufacturing, field → Higher rates
│   │   │   ├─ Class 4: Hazardous (construction, mining) → Highest rates
│   │   │   └─ Adjustment: Rate varies by class ±20-40% from standard
│   │   └─ Participation:
│   │       ├─ Mandatory (employer-paid): Typical; automatic coverage
│   │       ├─ Voluntary: Employee pays premium; can waive (rare)
│   │       ├─ Hybrid: Employer covers base; employee buys supplemental
│   │       └─ Portability: Some plans portable after job loss (continuation option)
│   ├─ Covered Conditions:
│   │   ├─ Medical definition of disability:
│   │   │   ├─ "Unable to perform duties of own occupation" (most common)
│   │   │   ├─ "Unable to engage in any gainful occupation" (more restrictive)
│   │   │   ├─ "Medically necessary medical treatment" (liberal; includes rehab)
│   │   │   └─ Application: Definition affects frequency of claims
│   │   ├─ Covered conditions:
│   │   │   ├─ Pregnancy & childbirth: Covered if medically necessary
│   │   │   ├─ Surgery recovery: Typical major claim driver (40-50% of claims)
│   │   │   ├─ Illness: Flu, pneumonia, hospitalization
│   │   │   ├─ Injury (non-occupational): Car accident, fall at home
│   │   │   ├─ Mental health: Covered if incapacity documented
│   │   │   ├─ Orthopedic: Back injuries, fractures, joint issues (20-30% of claims)
│   │   │   └─ Chronic disease: Cancer treatment, kidney disease under care
│   │   ├─ Exclusions (typical):
│   │   │   ├─ Work-related: Covered by workers' comp instead
│   │   │   ├─ Pre-existing condition: May exclude if onset within 12 months
│   │   │   ├─ Alcohol/drug-related: Impairment from substance abuse
│   │   │   ├─ Intentional self-injury: Suicide, self-inflicted harm
│   │   │   ├─ Committing crime: Injury while committing felony
│   │   │   ├─ Cosmetic: Elective surgery for appearance only
│   │   │   ├─ High-risk activity: Extreme sports, racing, skydiving (varies)
│   │   │   └─ Medical non-compliance: Refuse necessary treatment
│   │   └─ Burden of proof:
│   │       ├─ Employee responsibility: Provide medical evidence of incapacity
│   │       ├─ Insurer assessment: May require independent medical exam (IME)
│   │       ├─ Threshold: Must meet definition; not just "feeling bad"
│   │       └─ Example: Back injury; employee claims can't work; insurer requires MRI + physical exam
│   └─ Integration with Other Benefits:
│       ├─ Coordination with paid leave (PTO/sick):
│       │   ├─ Typical: Employee uses PTO first; STD begins after
│       │   ├─ PTO exhaustion: Days remaining before STD starts
│       │   ├─ Example: Employee has 10 PTO days; uses for 2 weeks off; STD starts day 11
│       │   └─ Employer decision: Can integrate (counts against both) or not
│       ├─ Coordination with LTD (Long-Term Disability):
│       │   ├─ Transition: STD benefit-period ends; LTD may begin
│       │   ├─ Elimination period: LTD often has 90-180 day wait; overlaps with STD
│       │   ├─ Coordination of benefits: No double-payment; highest benefit applies
│       │   ├─ Example: STD ends week 13; LTD has 90-day (week 13) elimination; no gap
│       │   └─ Integrated plans: Single income stream STD→LTD; seamless transition
│       ├─ Workers' compensation coordination:
│       │   ├─ If work-related: Workers' comp primary; STD secondary or excluded
│       │   ├─ Statutory requirement: Most states require coordination
│       │   ├─ Example: Workplace injury; workers' comp pays 66.67%; STD offset to avoid double-pay
│       │   └─ Coordination formula: Total benefits ≤ 66.67% of salary (most common)
│       ├─ Statutory benefit (state mandates):
│       │   ├─ NY, NJ, RI, HI, CA: State disability insurance (SDI) mandatory
│       │   ├─ Private plans: May replace or supplement state plan
│       │   ├─ Funding: Employer/employee contributions (varies by state)
│       │   └─ Advantage: Employer coordination minimizes exposure
│       └─ Social Security Disability (SSD/SSDI):
│           ├─ Longer-term: 12+ months disability required for qualification
│           ├─ Coordination: STD typically runs concurrently
│           ├─ Benefits if approved: SSD payments + reduced STD (offset)
│           ├─ Processing time: 6-24 months for SSD approval
│           └─ Example: Employee disabled year 1; receives STD 26 weeks; applies for SSD; approved year 2; STD ends
├─ Benefit Design & Amounts:
│   ├─ Replacement Ratio:
│   │   ├─ Standard: 50% of gross salary (conservative; discourages prolonged claims)
│   │   ├─ Mid-range: 60% of gross salary (common employer choice)
│   │   ├─ Generous: 70% of gross salary (competitive plans; finance/tech)
│   │   ├─ Maximum cap: Often no cap up to first few months; then may be fixed dollar
│   │   ├─ Example: Salary $100K
│   │   │   ├─ 50% replacement = $50K/year = $961/week
│   │   │   ├─ 60% replacement = $60K/year = $1,154/week
│   │   │   ├─ 70% replacement = $70K/year = $1,346/week
│   │   │   └─ Typical weekly benefit: $800-$2,500 (average $1,200)
│   │   └─ Tax treatment:
│   │       ├─ Employer-paid premiums: Benefit is TAXABLE INCOME (unlike group life)
│   │       ├─ Employee-paid premiums: Benefit may be tax-free (IRC §104(a)(3))
│   │       ├─ Practical: Most employers don't withhold; employee surprises at tax time
│   │       └─ Planning: Some employers net benefit (reduce check) to account for taxes
│   ├─ Benefit Duration:
│   │   ├─ Short-term definition: 13 weeks (3 months) minimum
│   │   ├─ Range: 13-26 weeks typical (3-6 months)
│   │   ├─ Extended STD: Some plans offer 39 weeks (9 months)
│   │   ├─ Schedule:
│   │   │   ├─ Weeks 1-2: Often 100% of salary (paid leave overlap)
│   │   │   ├─ Weeks 3-13: 60% of salary (core STD period)
│   │   │   ├─ Weeks 14-26: Reduced to 50% of salary (encourages return)
│   │   │   └─ Example: Common formula = "100%-60%-50%" structure
│   │   ├─ Interaction with LTD:
│   │   │   ├─ Total duration if continuity: 26 weeks STD + 39-40 years LTD = 40+ years potential
│   │   │   ├─ Rarely used fully: Most claims resolve within 13 weeks; <5% go to LTD
│   │   │   └─ Financial impact: Employer budgets for <2% of payroll in STD claims
│   │   └─ Calendar limit:
│   │       ├─ Per benefit period: Cannot collect more than benefit duration per year
│   │       ├─ Example: 26-week plan; employee 2 separate leaves = 13 weeks each
│   │       ├─ Calendar year aggregate: May limit to 52 weeks total in 12-month period
│   │       └─ Recurrence: If return to work <30 days, then off again; usually same period resets
│   ├─ Elimination Period (Waiting Period):
│   │   ├─ Definition: Days employee must be unable to work before STD kicks in
│   │   ├─ Common lengths: 0, 7, 14, 30 days
│   │   ├─0-day elimination (rare): Immediate coverage; expensive to insurer
│   │   ├─ 7-day elimination (common): One week unpaid; standard for employer plans
│   │   ├─ 14-day elimination: Two weeks off; reduces claims frequency
│   │   ├─ 30-day elimination (rigorous): One month off; discourages frivolous claims
│   │   ├─ Interaction with PTO:
│   │   │   ├─ Waived if PTO available: Employee uses PTO for elimination period
│   │   │   ├─ Counts as elimination: Days off count toward waiting period; then STD starts
│   │   │   ├─ Example: 7-day elimination, 5 PTO days used; 2 more unpaid days; STD begins day 8
│   │   │   └─ Advantage: Integrated plans discourage malingering
│   │   └─ Design impact:
│   │       ├─ Longer elimination = Lower claims frequency = Lower premium
│   │       ├─ Cost relationship: 7-day vs 30-day elimination ≈ 20-30% premium difference
│   │       ├─ Trade-off: Employer chooses between affordability and employee protection
│   │       └─ Risk: Very long elimination penalizes legitimate injuries
│   └─ Maximum Benefit Cap:
│       ├─ Per week limit: Often $1,500-$3,000/week (state-dependent)
│       ├─ Aggregate cap: Total benefit per benefit period; e.g., $30K for 26-week plan
│       ├─ Example: 60% replacement of $150K salary = $90K/year = $1,731/week
│       │   ├─ If plan cap is $1,200/week; actual benefit = $1,200/week (capped)
│       │   ├─ Loss of coverage for overage: Employee absorbs difference
│       │   └─ Supplemental coverage: Employee may buy voluntary STD for coverage above cap
│       └─ Policy maximum: Over 26-week benefit period; cannot exceed stated maximum
├─ Medical Underwriting & Claims:
│   ├─ Claim Triggering:
│   │   ├─ Event: Employee unable to work; calls employer/insurer to file claim
│   │   ├─ Initial contact: Within 24-48 hours; claim form sent to employee
│   │   ├─ Required documentation:
│   │   │   ├─ Claim form: Signed by employee with details of condition
│   │   │   ├─ Physician's statement: Doctor certifies disability, expected duration
│   │   │   ├─ Employment verification: Employer confirms salary, employment status
│   │   │   ├─ Medical records: May be requested; test results, treatment plan
│   │   │   └─ Proof of incapacity: Hospital discharge, treatment records
│   │   └─ Processing time:
│   │       ├─ Straightforward (routine): 5-10 business days approval
│   │       ├─ Requires investigation: 15-30 days; may need IME or additional records
│   │       ├─ Complex (mental health, chronic): 30-60 days; psychiatric evaluation possible
│       └─ Contestation window: 2-3 years from date of claim (statute of limitations)
│   ├─ Proof of Continuing Disability:
│   │   ├─ Periodic certification:
│   │   │   ├─ Monthly requirement: Employee submits doctor's certification
│   │   │   ├─ Purpose: Verify condition continues; employment attempted?
│   │   │   ├─ Burden: Employee responsibility; failure to provide = benefit suspension
│   │   │   └─ Cost: Employer often pays doctor's certification fees (~$25-50 per month)
│   │   ├─ Return-to-work assessment:
│   │   │   ├─ Modified duty: Can employee work part-time? Different role?
│   │   │   ├─ Example: Accountant with back injury; can do data-entry (sedentary)?
│   │   │   ├─ Partial disability benefit: 50-75% of full benefit if part-time return
│   │   │   ├─ Incentive: Encourages partial return; reduces total cost
│   │   │   └─ Durational: Partial benefit may continue 6-13 weeks (encourages full return)
│   │   ├─ Independent medical exam (IME):
│   │   │   ├─ Insurer right: May order IME to verify disability (annual for long-term cases)
│   │   │   ├─ Purpose: Verify physician assessment; check for malingering
│   │   │   ├─ Cost: Insurer pays; employee must cooperate
│   │   │   ├─ Frequency: Typically annual for continuing claims
│   │   │   ├─ Conflict of interest: IME selected by insurer; employee may distrust
│   │   │   └─ Dispute: If IME contradicts treating physician; coverage may be denied pending appeal
│   │   └─ Vocational rehabilitation assessment:
│   │       ├─ Longer claims: If approaching 26 weeks; insurer may assess return-to-work potential
│   │       ├─ Retraining: If employee can't return to same job; can do different work?
│   │       ├─ Example: Warehouse worker with permanent wrist injury; can do office work?
│   │       ├─ Benefit: Encourages return; reduces long-term claims into LTD territory
│   │       └─ Cost: Vocational rehab expenses paid by insurer (cheaper than 52-week benefit)
│   └─ Claim Denial Scenarios:
│       ├─ Pre-existing condition exclusion:
│       │   ├─ Not covered: Condition diagnosed within 12 months before benefit date
│       │   ├─ Rationale: Prevent adverse selection (sick applicant immediately files claim)
│       │   ├─ Lookback period: Typically 12 months (varies by policy)
│       │   ├─ Example: Employee hired Jan 2025; diagnosed with back condition Feb 2025; claim denied (pre-ex exclusion)
│       │   └─ Exception: Employee must disclose in application; if hidden, denial based on misstatement
│       ├─ Lack of medical evidence:
│       │   ├─ Insufficient documentation: Physician refuses to complete certification
│       │   ├─ Employee remedy: Obtain cooperation from doctor; provide to insurer
│       │   ├─ Insurer recourse: May order IME; if IME finds no disability, deny claim
│       │   └─ Appeal: Employee can appeal; provide additional evidence
│       ├─ Not disabled per definition:
│       │   ├─ Example: "Own occupation" definition; employee can perform modified duty
│       │   ├─ Insurer finding: Employee capable of work despite medical condition
│       │   ├─ Example: Office worker with arthritis; pain exists but can type/use computer
│       │   └─ Employee recourse: Appeal with treating physician support
│       ├─ Voluntary off-work:
│       │   ├─ Taking time off without medical incapacity
│       │   ├─ Example: Employee leaves job; claims disability; physician reluctant to certify
│       │   ├─ Insurer investigation: Interview employer, coworkers; discipline employee if no real condition
│       │   └─ Termination: If fraud discovered, all benefits recovered; criminal referral possible
│       └─ Exceeds benefit period:
│           ├─ After 26 weeks: STD exhausted; must move to LTD or return to work
│           ├─ Continued disability: If LTD available, claim transitions; otherwise benefits end
│           ├─ Gap coverage: Few plans offer extension; employee faces gap if LTD waiting period
│           └─ Employee remedy: Negotiate continuation with employer; appeal to insurer for extension
├─ Claims Administration & Costs:
│   ├─ Frequency & Severity:
│   │   ├─ Claim frequency: 2-5% of covered employees file per year (typical range)
│   │   │   ├─ Industry variation: Office 2-3%; manufacturing 4-6%; healthcare 5-8%
│   │   │   ├─ Workplace factors: Ergonomics, safety, stress levels affect rate
│   │   │   └─ Trend: Post-COVID mental health claims ↑ 20-30% (normalization)
│   │   ├─ Severity (average claim cost):
│   │   │   ├─ Average duration: 15-20 days (most claims short; quick recovery)
│   │   │   ├─ Percentage >26 days: ~15-20% extend to full benefit period
│   │   │   ├─ Percentage LTD transition: ~5% of STD claims progress to LTD
│   │   │   └─ Cost impact: Few long claims drive bulk of expense
│   │   ├─ Example employer cost calculation:
│   │   │   ├─ Company: 1,000 employees, $50K average salary
│   │   │   ├─ STD design: 60% replacement, 26 weeks, 7-day elimination
│   │   │   ├─ Expected frequency: 3% = 30 claims/year
│   │   │   ├─ Average duration: 18 days per claim
│   │   │   ├─ Average benefit: 60% × $50K / 52 weeks × 2.57 weeks = $1,538/claim
│   │   │   ├─ Total expected cost: 30 claims × $1,538 = $46,140/year
│   │   │   ├─ Per employee cost: $46,140 / 1,000 = $46.14/year = 0.09% of payroll
│   │   │   └─ Insurance premium: Add 20-30% for admin/profit = $55-60/employee/year
│   │   └─ Reservation & funding:
│   │       ├─ Insured plans: Insurer holds reserves; employer pays fixed premium
│   │       ├─ Self-funded plans: Employer self-insures; accumulates reserve for claims
│   │       ├─ Third-party administration: Employer + TPA manage claims; insurer reinsures
│   │       └─ Financial impact: Premium/reserve typically 0.1-0.2% of covered payroll
│   ├─ Return-to-Work Programs:
│   │   ├─ Modified duty:
│   │   │   ├─ Description: Employee returns but with restrictions (lighter duties, fewer hours)
│   │   │   ├─ Objective: Partial income + benefit while recovery continues
│   │   │   ├─ Employer role: Identifies suitable modified work; coordinates with employee
│   │   │   ├─ Partial disability benefit: Typically 50-75% of full STD amount
│   │   │   ├─ Duration: 4-13 weeks of modified work (encourages full return)
│   │   │   └─ Example: Employee works 50% schedule on return-to-work; receives 50% salary + 50% STD
│   │   ├─ Graduated return:
│   │   │   ├─ Phase-in: Week 1-2: 50% hours; Week 3-4: 75% hours; Week 5+: Full
│   │   │   ├─ Benefit blend: Full STD in weeks 1-2; reduces as hours increase
│   │   │   ├─ Medical supervision: Doctor clears each phase increase
│   │   │   └─ Success: 80-90% of employees successfully transition (fewer drop back)
│   │   ├─ Employer coordination:
│   │   │   ├─ Obligation: ADA compliance; no discrimination based on disability
│   │   │   ├─ Interactive process: Employer + employee + doctor collaborate on return plan
│   │   │   ├─ Duty of good faith: Employer can't deny reasonable modified work
│   │   │   └─ Liability: Failure to accommodate may trigger EEOC complaint
│   │   └─ Cost-benefit:
│   │       ├─ Modified work benefit: Reduces claim duration by 1-2 weeks average
│   │       ├─ Savings: ~$200-500 per claim (if prevents full 26-week benefit)
│   │       ├─ Investment: Employer time to identify suitable work; opportunity cost
│   │       └─ ROI: Typically positive; 2-3 year payback on program infrastructure
│   └─ Claim Administration Cost:
│       ├─ Insurer handling: 8-12% of premium (claims processing, investigation, payouts)
│       ├─ Employer administration: 2-5% of payroll (HR staff time, enrollment, certification collection)
│       ├─ Total administrative load: 15-20% of total cost (similar to life insurance)
│       └─ Opportunity: Self-funding or TPA models often cheaper; reduced admin load
├─ Regulatory & Compliance:
│   ├─ State Mandates:
│   │   ├─ Mandatory states: NY, NJ, RI, HI, CA require disability coverage
│   │   │   ├─ Minimum coverage: Replacement ratio at least 50-60%
│   │   │   ├─ Funding: Employee contributions; ranges 0.5-1% of payroll
│   │   │   ├─ Employer option: Provide private plan OR use state plan
│   │   │   ├─ Integration: Many employers self-insure supplemental above state minimum
│   │   │   └─ Compliance: Quarterly reporting to state disability agency
│   │   └─ Non-mandatory states: Employer discretion; no legal requirement to offer
│   ├─ ERISA Compliance (if employer-sponsored group):
│   │   ├─ Plan document: Must describe benefit, eligibility, claims process
│   │   ├─ SPD (Summary Plan Description): Employees must receive plain-language description
│   │   ├─ Claims procedure: Fair process for claims and appeals; neutral reviewer
│   │   ├─ Fiduciary duty: Employer must manage plan in participant interest
│   │   ├─ Non-discrimination: Plan can't discriminate based on health status
│   │   └─ Form 5500 filing: Required if ≥100 participants; annual DOL/IRS filing
│   ├─ ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act):
│   │   ├─ Interactive process: Employer required to work with disabled employee on accommodation
│   │   ├─ Confidentiality: Medical information protected; limited disclosure
│   │   ├─ Non-discrimination: Can't treat disabled employee differently if qualified
│   │   └─ Disability benefit: Protected; can't retaliate for filing claim
│   ├─ Medical Privacy (HIPAA):
│   │   ├─ Medical information: Protected health information (PHI) confidential
│   │   ├─ Authorized disclosure: Only with employee consent (limited)
│   │   ├─ Employer access: Usually limited; insurer holds PHI
│   │   ├─ TPA handling: If third-party administers, must sign Business Associate agreement
│   │   └─ Breach notification: If data compromised, employees notified within 60 days
│   └─ Tax Treatment (IRC):
│       ├─ Employer-paid premiums: Tax-deductible business expense
│       ├─ Employee-paid premiums: Usually paid pre-tax (payroll deduction); reduces taxable income
│       ├─ Benefit proceeds: TAXABLE INCOME (unlike group life); employee owes income tax
│       ├─ Tax reporting: Employer reports STD benefit on employee's W-2 or 1099
│       └─ Planning: Savvy employees budget for tax withholding; may reduce net benefit
└─ Strategic Considerations:
    ├─ Employer Benefits:
    │   ├─ Retention: Shows care for employee well-being; loyalty builder
    │   ├─ Productivity: Reduces short absences; clarity on income support
    │   ├─ Compliance: Meets regulatory requirements; reduces legal liability
    │   └─ Costs: Manageable; typically 0.1-0.2% of payroll
    ├─ Employee Benefits:
    │   ├─ Income security: Provides cushion during recovery; prevents financial crisis
    │   ├─ Peace of mind: Reduces stress; focuses on healing
    │   ├─ Job security: Assurance of job availability during leave
    │   └─ Limitations: Only partial replacement; may require budget cuts
    ├─ Employer Design Decisions:
    │   ├─ Premium control: Longer elimination + shorter duration → lower cost
    │   ├─ Employee retention: Higher replacement % + shorter elimination → higher cost but better morale
    │   ├─ Integrated programs: STD + LTD + workers' comp → simplified, coordinated administration
    │   └─ Voluntary supplement: Offer employee-paid optional coverage above plan minimum
    └─ Competitive Benchmarking:
        ├─ Market comparison: 70% of large employers offer STD (vs 40% small)
        ├─ Tech/finance: More generous (70%+ replacement, 26 weeks, 0 elimination)
        ├─ Manufacturing: More conservative (60% replacement, 13 weeks, 7-14 day elimination)
        ├─ Public sector: Often most generous (80%+ replacement, extended duration)
        └─ Trend: STD becoming table-stakes benefit; competitive pressure to match market
```

**Key Insight:** STD efficient bridge coverage; eliminates through paid leave; coordinates with LTD; costs modest ~0.1% payroll; claims frequent but short-duration

## 6. Challenge Round
When STD fails:
- **Pre-ex trap**: Employee has chronic back condition; hired; immediately files STD; claim denied for pre-ex exclusion; legal battle over when condition "began"
- **Medical disagreement**: Treating physician certifies disability; insurer's IME contradicts; says employee can work; benefit denied; employee appeals; 3-month delay
- **Return-to-work refusal**: Employee cleared for modified duty; refuses; claims job unsuitable; insurer contends STD should terminate; both escalate
- **Fraudulent claim**: Employee on STD; social media photos show hiking, athletic activity; insurer investigates; discovers fraud; benefit denied retroactively; criminal referral
- **ERISA violation**: Employer denies claim without proper appeals process; employee sues under ERISA; punitive damages awarded; policy reformed
- **Disability creep**: Employee returns with 50% capacity; employer pressures return to full duty; employee claims retaliation under ADA; complaint filed
