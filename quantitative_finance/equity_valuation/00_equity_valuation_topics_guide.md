## Key Distinctions from Credit Risk / Actuarial Valuation

1. **Equity-Centric**: Focus on shareholder value; residual claim on assets after debt
2. **Growth-Driven**: Terminal value critical; long-term assumptions dominate valuation
3. **Comparison-Heavy**: Relative multiples common; peer benchmarking typical
4. **Scenario Sensitivity**: High sensitivity to growth, margin, WACC assumptions; small changes → large value swings
5. **Market-Implied**: Market prices reflect consensus expectations; valuation tests if stock fairly priced
6. **Liquidity Focus**: Public equity; daily trading; marketability discount not typically applied
