# Content File Design Discussion

## 1. Purpose
This document guides how to design learning content files that balance simplicity, depth, and usability across topics.

## 2. Design Goals
- **Clarity:** Readers should understand the concept after one pass.
- **Transfer:** Learners can apply the idea in new contexts.
- **Recall:** The file supports long-term retention.
- **Scalability:** Structure works for short and deep topics.
- **Consistency:** Navigation and sections feel familiar across files.

## 3. Decision Criteria
- **Audience level:** Intro, core, or advanced.
- **Concept type:** Definition, method, proof, model, or framework.
- **Complexity:** Number of layers needed to understand.
- **Application need:** Practical usage vs theory focus.
- **Error risk:** Common misconceptions to guard against.
- **Time budget:** Expected reading time.

## 4. Tradeoffs to Manage
- **Simplicity vs completeness:** Fewer sections can hide important nuance.
- **Breadth vs depth:** Wider coverage dilutes learning focus.
- **Intuition vs rigor:** Too much of either can block understanding.
- **Examples vs theory:** More examples improve transfer but add length.

## 5. Candidate Structures
### 5.1 Minimal
Best for: fast notes, quick refresh, definitions.
Core sections: definition, steps, example, pitfalls, quick check.

### 5.2 Balanced
Best for: core methods, widely used models.
Core sections: concept skeleton, comparison, examples, layers, mini-project.

### 5.3 Problem-Driven
Best for: applied learning or workflow tasks.
Core sections: goal, anchor problem, minimum theory, walkthrough, validation.

### 5.4 Recall-Drill
Best for: exam prep and spaced repetition.
Core sections: overview, micro-examples, error triggers, flashcards, self-test.

## 6. Selection Heuristics
- If learners need to do a task, use problem-driven.
- If concept is foundational, use balanced.
- If topic is compact, use minimal.
- If retention is the priority, use recall-drill.

## 7. Quality Checklist
- Does the definition avoid circular language?
- Is there at least one counterexample or failure case?
- Are assumptions explicit?
- Are examples small enough to compute quickly?
- Is there a short self-check to verify understanding?
- Are references authoritative and stable?

## 8. Content Density Targets
- **Minimal:** 300–600 words.
- **Balanced:** 600–1,200 words.
- **Problem-driven:** 700–1,500 words.
- **Recall-drill:** 400–900 words.

## 9. Maintenance Practices
- Keep section headers consistent across files.
- Use short sentences and avoid unnecessary jargon.
- Prefer one high-quality reference over many low-quality links.
- Update examples if assumptions change or better datasets exist.

## 10. Reference Patterns
- Definitions: encyclopedic or textbook sources.
- Methods: lecture notes or statistical references.
- Applications: reputable industry or academic sources.
