# Exploiting Table Selection: Finding +EV Games & Conditions

## 1. Concept Skeleton
**Definition:** Systematic process to identify and select casino games, tables, and conditions with positive expected value for the player  
**Purpose:** Focus play only on +EV opportunities; avoid negative EV games; maximize edge capture; efficient bankroll deployment  
**Prerequisites:** Expected value calculation, house edge knowledge, game comparisons, bankroll management

## 2. Comparative Framing
| Factor | High RTP Table | Favorable Rules | Good Penetration | Weak Competition | Dealer Carelessness |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **EV Impact** | +0.5-1.5% | +0.1-0.5% | +0.2-1% | +1-3% (poker) | +2-10% (blackjack) |
| **Availability** | Moderate | Common | Variable | High (poker) | Rare |
| **Detectability** | Easy | Easy | Medium | Easy | Hard |
| **Sustainability** | High | High | High | High | Low |
| **Requires Skill** | No | No | No | Yes (poker) | No (observation) |
| **Exploitation Time** | Days-weeks | Days-weeks | Days-weeks | Hours-days | Minutes-hours |

## 3. Examples + Counterexamples

**Simple Example:**  
Blackjack at Casino A: 6-deck shoe, S17 (dealer hits soft 17), 75% penetration, -0.3% HE vs Casino B (8-deck, H17, 60% penetration, -0.8% HE) → Play Casino A

**Failure Case:**  
Assuming video poker pays 9/6 (99% RTP) without verifying pay table; actually 8/5 (96% RTP) → no edge despite location

**Edge Case:**  
Poker table has strong players; even though rake is favorable, winning probability against good opponents null → avoid; wait for weak game

## 4. Layer Breakdown
```
Table Selection Framework:
├─ I. GAME SELECTION CRITERIA:
│   ├─ Expected Value Analysis:
│   │   ├─ Calculate HE for each game variant
│   │   ├─ Example: Blackjack -0.5%, Craps -1.4%, Roulette -2.7%
│   │   ├─ Ranking: Always choose highest RTP game available
│   │   ├─ Opportunity cost: Playing -2% game instead of -0.5% = 1.5% worse annually
│   │   ├─ Decision matrix: Only play -1% or better games
│   │   └─ Implication: May skip games that don't meet threshold
│   ├─ Game Rules Comparison:
│   │   ├─ Blackjack variants:
│   │   │   ├─ 6-deck vs 8-deck: 6-deck slightly better (+0.05% approx)
│   │   │   ├─ S17 vs H17: Dealer hits soft 17 costs player ~0.2% edge
│   │   │   ├─ DAS (Double After Split): Adds ~0.2% player edge
│   │   │   ├─ Resplit Aces: Adds ~0.08% player edge
│   │   │   ├─ Blackjack payout: 3:2 vs 6:5; difference = 1.4% house edge swing!
│   │   │   └─ Rule combination: Table with 6-deck, S17, DAS, 3:2 payout = best
│   │   ├─ Video Poker variants:
│   │   │   ├─ 9/6 Jacks-or-Better: 99.5% RTP (excellent)
│   │   │   ├─ 8/5 Jacks-or-Better: 97.3% RTP (acceptable)
│   │   │   ├─ 7/5 Jacks-or-Better: 95.0% RTP (avoid)
│   │   │   ├─ Bonus Poker: Varies widely (90-102% RTP by paytable)
│   │   │   ├─ Deuces Wild: 100%+ RTP if perfect pay table
│   │   │   └─ Paytable verification: Must confirm exact payouts before play
│   │   ├─ Craps bets:
│   │   │   ├─ Pass Line: 1.41% HE (avoid)
│   │   │   ├─ Pass Line + Odds: HE drops to ~0.5-0.8% (depending on odds allowed)
│   │   │   ├─ Wrong bets: Similar HE; take odds
│   │   │   └─ Strategy: Always take max odds (house advantage reduced significantly)
│   │   └─ Comparison: Choose game with best rules available
│   ├─ Penetration Rates:
│   │   ├─ Definition: % of shoe dealt before reshuffle
│   │   ├─ Importance: Higher penetration = more cards seen; better counting accuracy
│   │   ├─ Ranges: 50% (poor), 75% (good), 85% (excellent)
│   │   ├─ Impact: 75% penetration vs 50% = +0.3% additional edge
│   │   ├─ Observation: Count hands dealt vs hands in shoe before reshuffle
│   │   ├─ Casino variation: Single casino may have 60% penetration at peak, 50% at night
│   │   └─ Strategy: Note penetration timing; return during favorable windows
│   ├─ Table Conditions:
│   │   ├─ Crowding: Busy table (fewer hands/hour); slow down long losing streaks
│   │   ├─ Dealer skill: Careless dealer = potential hole carding opportunity
│   │   ├─ Pit boss presence: Busy pit = less scrutiny; good for advantage players
│   │   ├─ Other players: Skilled vs weak competitors (matters in poker)
│   │   ├─ Heat level: Is the table being watched? Adjust play accordingly
│   │   └─ Timing: Shift changes, late night, slow periods = better conditions
│   └─ Rake Structure (Poker):
│       ├─ House rake: 4% vs 5% vs 6% of pot (varies by casino)
│       ├─ Impact: 2% rake swing = $4 difference per $200 pot
│       ├─ Comparison: Casinos with 3-4% rake much more profitable
│       ├─ Tournament: Fixed-fee tournaments bypass rake concern
│       └─ Strategy: Always choose lowest-rake game available
├─ II. SPOTTING EXPLOITABLE CONDITIONS:
│   ├─ Weak Poker Games:
│   │   ├─ Indicator 1: Large pots (loose players, over-betting)
│   │   ├─ Indicator 2: Player variance high (weak players calling too much)
│   │   ├─ Indicator 3: Few position raises (lack of strategic play)
│   │   ├─ Indicator 4: Multiple players per hand (rake dilution; less skill)
│   │   ├─ Test: Sit and observe 15-20 hands before committing
│   │   ├─ Decision: Only play if you're clearly stronger than most players
│   │   └─ Exit: Leave immediately if table tightens (skilled players joined)
│   ├─ Favorable Casino Conditions:
│   │   ├─ Shift change: Dealer rotation time (chaos; reduced supervision)
│   │   ├─ Shift end: Tired dealers; more careless (hole carding opportunities)
│   │   ├─ Busy casino: Pit boss focused elsewhere; advantage players less noticed
│   │   ├─ New table: Freshly opened (dealer/supervisor not coordinated)
│   │   ├─ Special events: Tournaments, promotions (casino attention elsewhere)
│   │   ├─ Late night: Minimum staff; fewer eyes on table
│   │   └─ Observation: Scout 30-60 minutes before committing large bets
│   ├─ Negative Indicators (Avoid):
│   │   ├─ Continuous shuffler: Counting impossible; skip entirely
│   │   ├─ No penetration: Card reshuffle every 2-3 hands; don't bother
│   │   ├─ 6:5 blackjack payout: Skip; house edge too high
│   │   ├─ No double after split: Minor; prefer casinos with DAS
│   │   ├─ Strong poker field: Folding equity negative; wait for better game
│   │   ├─ Heavy surveillance: If noticed/watched, don't attempt advantage play
│   │   └─ Intuition: If something feels wrong, trust it; leave
│   └─ Positive Indicators (Seek):
│       ├─ 3:2 blackjack payout (confirmed)
│       ├─ 6-deck shoes with good penetration
│       ├─ Multiple table options (flexibility in selection)
│       ├─ Loose poker field (many weak players)
│       ├─ Low video poker competition (machines available)
│       ├─ Dealer mistakes (exposed cards, poor technique)
│       └─ Relative anonymity (not a "known" advantage player location)
├─ III. INFORMATION GATHERING:
│   ├─ Pre-Visit Research:
│   │   ├─ Casino website: Publicized game rules, payout percentages
│   │   ├─ Advantage player forums: Reviews of specific casinos, penetration rates
│   │   ├─ Surveillance alerts: Warning if casino known for heat/barring
│   │   ├─ Regional reputation: Some casinos player-friendly; others hostile
│   │   ├─ Strategy guides: Wizard of Odds has detailed rule/HE comparisons
│   │   └─ Social media: Recent visitor reports on game quality/selection
│   ├─ On-Site Reconnaissance (Scouting):
│   │   ├─ Duration: 30-90 minutes ideal; observe without committing
│   │   ├─ Observation points:
│   │   │   ├─ Game availability: How many tables? What variations?
│   │   │   ├─ Rules posted: Confirm payout percentages, rule sets
│   │   │   ├─ Penetration: Count cards dealt to estimate reshuffle frequency
│   │   │   ├─ Dealer behavior: How do they handle cards? Any exposures?
│   │   │   ├─ Pit boss activity: Distracted? Aggressive surveillance?
│   │   │   ├─ Player mix: Weak vs strong competitors (poker specific)
│   │   │   └─ Dealer rotation: When do shifts change? Timing note for return visit
│   │   ├─ Note-taking: Mental notes only (written notes = surveillance flag)
│   │   ├─ Disguise: Appear casual/interested, not calculating/analytical
│   │   └─ Decision point: Scout + 1-2 test hands → commit or abandon
│   ├─ Benchmarking Across Locations:
│   │   ├─ Comparative matrix: Record rules/penetration for each venue
│   │   ├─ Ranking: Order casinos by EV advantage potential
│   │   ├─ Geographic advantage: Identify best casino within driving distance
│   │   ├─ Rotation strategy: Visit casinos in sequence before any single location bars you
│   │   └─ Long-term planning: Build database of good venues for future visits
│   └─ Feedback Integration:
│       ├─ Results: Track performance at each location (confirms selection quality)
│       ├─ Adjustment: If venue underperforms, investigate rule/penetration changes
│       ├─ Barring: Track which casinos have made you for advantage play
│       ├─ Communities: Share intelligence with poker/counting communities (safely)
│       └─ Iteration: Continuously refine location selection process
├─ IV. EXPLOIT COMBINATIONS:
│   ├─ Blackjack Optimization:
│   │   ├─ Baseline: 6-deck, S17, DAS, 3:2 payout = -0.3% HE
│   │   ├─ With counting: +0.5-1.5% edge achievable
│   │   ├─ Combined: Net effect +0.2-1.2% player advantage
│   │   ├─ Selection impact: Choosing -0.3% vs -1.5% table = 1.2% difference
│   │   ├─ Annual impact: $2400 difference per $100k wagered annually
│   │   └─ Decision: Location matters as much as counting skill
│   ├─ Poker Selection:
│   │   ├─ Game choice: Pick lowest rake (3-4% vs 5-6% = 1-2% difference)
│   │   ├─ Competition: Choose table where you're top 3 players (edges 1-3%+)
│   │   ├─ Combined: Weak table + low rake = 3-5% total advantage possible
│   │   ├─ Validation: If sitting, winning consistently → selection working
│   │   └─ Exit trigger: If game tightens/strong players join → leave immediately
│   ├─ Multi-Game Rotation:
│   │   ├─ Strategy: Play multiple games to diversify and reduce detection
│   │   ├─ Example: 4 hours blackjack, 2 hours poker, 1 hour video poker
│   │   ├─ Benefit: Vary betting patterns; avoid "regular counter" reputation
│   │   ├─ Risk: Splitting focus may reduce max edge capture on any single game
│   │   └─ Balance: Find optimal allocation for your skills/opportunities
│   └─ Seasonal Variation:
│       ├─ Tourist seasons: More casual players; easier weaker competition
│       ├─ Promotional periods: Casinos less focused on surveillance
│       ├─ Off-season: Fewer eyes; but also fewer soft games
│       ├─ Timing: Strategic visits during optimal seasons
│       └─ Planning: Schedule trips when conditions most favorable
├─ V. DECISION FRAMEWORKS:
│   ├─ Before Sitting Down:
│   │   ├─ Checklist:
│   │   │   ├─ Game rules: Confirmed favorable payout? (Yes → continue; No → skip)
│   │   │   ├─ Penetration: Adequate for advantage play? (Yes → continue; No → skip)
│   │   │   ├─ Competition: Weak field if poker? (Yes → continue; No → sit elsewhere)
│   │   │   ├─ Surveillance: Light heat/attention? (Low → continue; High → defer)
│   │   │   ├─ Bankroll: Have sufficient capital for variance? (Yes → continue; No → wait)
│   │   │   └─ Exit plan: Know stopping point? (Clear → sit; Unclear → reconsider)
│   │   ├─ Go/No-Go Decision: Must pass ALL criteria to proceed
│   │   └─ Abort threshold: If any red flag, defer to another session
│   ├─ During Play:
│   │   ├─ Continuous evaluation: Table conditions changing?
│   │   ├─ Heat indicators: Surveillance increasing? Dealer changed?
│   │   ├─ Profitability: Are you ahead/behind expected EV?
│   │   ├─ Quit point: Pre-set profit target → exit when hit
│   │   ├─ Stop-loss: Pre-set loss limit → exit if exceeded
│   │   └─ Flexibility: Adapt strategy if conditions degrade
│   ├─ Exit Decision:
│   │   ├─ Natural exit: Hit profit target; return to hotel
│   │   ├─ Forced exit: Heat detected; gracefully leave
│   │   ├─ Strategic exit: Table degraded; move to another
│   │   ├─ Timing: Exit during natural break (new shoe, dinner, etc.)
│   │   └─ Discretion: Don't leave dramatically (hide advantage)
│   └─ Post-Session Analysis:
│       ├─ Results: Profit/loss matches expected EV?
│       ├─ Selection quality: Did venue meet expectations?
│       ├─ Adaptation: What worked? What didn't?
│       ├─ Feedback: Update location database
│       └─ Planning: Will you return? When?
└─ VI. PROFESSIONAL IMPLEMENTATION:
    ├─ Geographic Advantages:
    │   ├─ Regional hubs: Las Vegas, Atlantic City, Monaco, Macau
    │   ├─ Competition: More casinos → better table selection
    │   ├─ Disadvantage: More surveillance; more experienced staff
    │   ├─ Off-strip locations: Less competition; more careless dealers
    │   ├─ Strategy: Balance convenience vs. anonymity trade-offs
    │   └─ Network: Build knowledge across multiple venues
    ├─ Team Coordination:
    │   ├─ Scouts: Identify best tables ahead of main players
    │   ├─ Spotters: Communicate via coded signals when conditions ideal
    │   ├─ Main players: Execute exploits only at selected tables
    │   ├─ Efficiency: Maximize edge capture; minimize wasted time
    │   └─ Risk: Team members must be reliable; compromised team = all caught
    ├─ Bankroll Scaling:
    │   ├─ Table stakes: Match bet size to RTP difference
    │   ├─ Higher EV table: Larger bets justified (lower ruin risk)
    │   ├─ Lower EV table: Smaller bets; marginal return not worth risk
    │   ├─ Capital allocation: Prioritize best venues; skip marginal ones
    │   └─ Rebalancing: As bankroll grows, increase bet sizes proportionally
    ├─ Long-Term Sustainability:
    │   ├─ Venue rotation: Prevent over-exposing at single location
    │   ├─ Geographic diversity: Play different casinos in different jurisdictions
    │   ├─ Career progression: Start local; expand to regional/international
    │   ├─ Evolution: Advance from blackjack counting to poker to sports betting
    │   └─ Reality: Sustainable 2-5 years typically; then need new approach
    └─ Risk Mitigation:
        ├─ Barring management: If barred, move to next venue
        ├─ Legal counsel: Have lawyer on speed dial (unlikely but preparation)
        ├─ Financial: Keep records; understand tax implications of winnings
        ├─ Identity: Consider low profile (avoid "regular" reputation)
        └─ Exit strategy: Plan transition if advantage play becomes untenable
```

**Core Insight:** Game/table selection amplifies advantage by 1-3% through rules/penetration/competition choices; second-most-important factor after exploiting edge (first being bankroll management).

## 6. Challenge Round
**When does table selection not matter?**
- Continuous shufflers: Rules irrelevant; no counting edge possible
- Fixed-income gambling: Small-stakes, casual play; edge negligible
- Short sessions: Variance dominates; venue selection barely impacts results
- Tournament formats: Fixed payouts; RTP differences matter less
- Forced play: No choice in game/table (travel constraints)
